// Problem

// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "abab"
// Output: true
// Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.

// Example 2:
// Input: s = "aba"
// Output: false

// Example 3:
// Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
// Output: true
// Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
